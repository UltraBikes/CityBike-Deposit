# CityBike Deposit

This repository is for "CityBike Deposit"-demo for UltraHack 2016

## Notes of current project status

Currently all the code and screenshots are made for a ultrahack-demo - not for an actual application. We are on the process of developing an actual application for season 2017.

## Idea of the app

**Problem**: bitybike stations are often empty. Especially in the mornings around the main railway station.

**Current solution**: There is a man driving around with a pickup-truck and moving the bikes from full stations to empty ones.

**Our solution**: Our app will reward users for riding the bikes to empty stations.

**Business logic**: Current solution costs around 3e per biketransfer where as our app will reduce the costs to 1e per transfer incl. users reward and our provision.
